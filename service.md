### Service discovery and DNS

The cluster must not allow for ANY Ingress or Egress as a default.

Communications are only allowed to be opened to pods where absolutely necessary. The current application consists of a website, a database, and, also for compliance reasons, a backup system.

The database must be able to accept communication from both the website and the backup system.
The website needs to be able to accept ingress on port 80.
The backup server needs to be able to egress to the NFS.
Identify your resources
The pods and the namespaces have been labeled as follows:

Website:
role: website

Database:
role: database

Backup System:
role: backup-system


The Pods have been deployed as deployments to better support scaling, updates and rollbacks as new versions of the applications are developed.

Now the company needs you to create a way to have a stable way to connect to your database and website services throughout the cluster.

In Kubernetes, when you create a Service to expose one or more pods, Kubernetes automatically creates environment variables in each pod to hold information about the service. These environment variables allow pods to dynamically discover and communicate with each other without needing to hard-code IP addresses or service names.

How Environment Variables for Services are Created
When a service is created in Kubernetes, it gets assigned a fixed IP address (the ClusterIP) and a DNS name. Kubernetes then generates environment variables based on this service for all running pods in the namespace, allowing these pods to reference the service easily. Hereâ€™s how these environment variables are typically structured:

Service Name in Uppercase: The name of the service, converted to uppercase.
Service Name Suffixes:
_SERVICE_HOST: Contains the IP address of the service.
_SERVICE_PORT: Contains the port number that the service exposes.
For example, if you have a service named website-service in your Kubernetes cluster, Kubernetes generates the following environment variables for each pod in the same namespace:

WEBSITE_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST: The IP address of the website-service.
WEBSITE_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT: The port number on which website-service is listening.
Example
Let's assume you have a service named database-service in the database namespace, exposing a MySQL database. You might access this service from another pod in the same namespace using environment variables like this:

mysql -h $DATABASE_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST -P $DATABASE_SER

----------------------
----------------------

<details>
<summary>

Create a new pod in the website namespace and attach an interactive shell. Retrieve the value of the WEBSITE_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST environment variable and select the correct from the options ?

-------------------
In Kubernetes, a DNS record is automatically created for each service, following a specific format that includes the service name, namespace, and a default domain which is typically svc.cluster.local. This DNS naming convention ensures that each service can be uniquely identified across the cluster.

For a service named database-service in the database namespace, the full DNS name would be:

database-service.database.svc.cluster.local

The above can also be used with short DNS name as follows:
database-service.database

-----------------------------
-------------------

<details>
<summary>
Senario 4-
Launch the pod in the database namespace in interactive shell and use DNS name to connect to the website-service. Which is the correct way of accessing service using DNS name.

```bash
kubectl run test --image nginx -n database

kubectl exec -n database test -it -- bash
 curl website-service.website

 curl website-service.website.svc.cluster.local

Launch the pod website-deployment-{POD_HASH} in the website namespace and get the DNS nameserver and the search domains.

### Troubleshooting internal networking 


After you set up your initial PoC, you decided to go on a vacation because you have been working long stressful hours.
While you were away, the Junior Admin needed to deploy new application to the cluster. But he accidentally modified some of your manifests and completely modified cluster networking to the point where the website is not working anymore.
He panicked and canâ€™t remember everything that was modified. Unfortunately, you had not yet set up GitOps, so the Junior Adminâ€™s changes are permanent, and you will need to troubleshoot your way through to get the network back to ensure the website works properly again.
You will begin troubleshooting the network by investigating the CNIs for errors.

It appears that the website pods in the website namespace cannot connect to the database pod in the database namespace. Looks like it just hangs when trying to connect.
Open another terminal and execute a port forward to one of the website pods on ports 8000:5000 and execute the test-network.sh script.
Investigate the network policies in the website namespace and delete a network policy that is no longer needed.

There still seems to be a connection timeout between the website and the database. But at this point, we have validated that the network policies are once again configured properly.
Since we have validated that egress from the website is working in previous steps using the test-network.sh script, let's assume that there a problem with the database.
Remember that the database is also using a service. Investigate the service mysql-service in the database namespace and make the necessary changes.
Note: Test the connection using bash test-network.sh

```bash
 sh test-network.sh 
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8000 after 0 ms: Connection refused

The database is now reachable internally, but we are still getting a timeout error. The only difference is we are now getting an error when trying to connect Unknown MySQL server host 'mysql.database.svc.cluster.local'.
This hostname is actually configured as an environment variable in your website-deployment manifest as MYSQL_HOST, but it cannot be resolved. This is, in fact, incorrect. Modify this environment variable to the correct value in the website deployment.

As the internal networking is now resolved and the website can connect to the database, we need to resolve the connection issue for external networking.
Users are complaining that the URL they used to use to test the site is not responding.
We originally configured this to be set up with a nodePort service type. Knowing this, we need to investigate the service used for the website. Make necessary changes to resolve the website nodeport type service website-service-nodeport.
